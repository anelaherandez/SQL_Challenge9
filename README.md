## SQL_Challenge9

#For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Data Modeling
-Create an Entity Relationship Diagram of tables. This was done using the free QuickDBD website.

## Data Engineering
-Create Table Schema for each csv file. This was done by importing sql file from the ERD created from QuickDBD
